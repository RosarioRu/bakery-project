# _Pierre's Bakery_

#### By _**Rosario Ruvalcaba**_

#### _This program builds a simple console application that displays price and specials for 'Pierre's Bakery.' It utilizes auto-implemented properties and methods to calculate the order total based on user input for number of loaves and croissants desired._

## Technologies Used

* _C#_
* _.NET_
* _MSTest (Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk)_
* _Markdown_

## Description

_This project was created as an independent project for Epicodus in order to demonstrate understanding of test-driven-development in C#. The program takes user input and creates instances of the classes 'Bread' and 'Pastry.' Methods for calculating the cost of bread and pastry are then called on these instances.

The console application prints the total cost of the order to the user.

MSTest was used to unit test the Models. The price for bread/pastries varies due to 'specials' so branching was used to calculate price for each class independently (Bread/Pastry).
